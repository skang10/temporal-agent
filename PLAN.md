# TemporalAgent — Project Plan

An agentic analytics system that detects oil market regime shifts using macro, geopolitical, and energy-specific signals — bridging time series and tabular data with TabPFN as the inference backbone and an LLM agent as the reasoning orchestrator.

## Core Concept

Most real-world prediction problems have both a temporal dimension (things change over time) and a cross-sectional dimension (entities differ). TemporalAgent handles both — featurizing time series into tabular snapshots for TabPFN, orchestrated by an agent that decides what to look at, explains what it finds, and iterates.

**Key TabPFN advantage exploited**: In-context learning means no retraining. When new data arrives, just update the context window — a genuine architectural advantage over tree models for streaming/online scenarios.

## Components

### 1. `TimeSeriesFeaturizer`
Transforms raw time series into tabular snapshots.
- Rolling statistics: mean, std, min/max, skewness over multiple windows (5d, 20d, 60d)
- Lag features: t-1, t-5, t-20
- Momentum and rate-of-change
- Energy-specific regime features: inventory trend slope, rig count momentum, GPR level
- Enforces temporal ordering — no data leakage

### 2. TabPFN Inference Engine
Wraps `TabPFNClassifier` and `TabPFNRegressor` from the TabPFN library.
- Regime classifier: bull supercycle / range-bound / bust / geopolitical spike
- WTI price direction predictor: up/down next 4 weeks
- Energy equity outperformance predictor: XLE vs SPY next quarter
- Uncertainty quantification via ensemble diversity

### 3. LLM Agent
Orchestrates the full pipeline with tool use.

**Tools:**
- `fetch_data(source, series, date_range)` — pulls from EIA, FRED, yfinance
- `engineer_features(data, window_sizes, feature_types)` — calls TimeSeriesFeaturizer
- `run_tabpfn(X_train, y_train, X_test, task_type)` — runs inference
- `evaluate_features(feature_importances)` — SHAP-based analysis via tabpfn-extensions
- `detect_drift(recent_data, historical_data)` — flags distribution shift
- `explain_prediction(prediction, features, context)` — natural language explanation
- `backtest(strategy, date_range)` — walk-forward evaluation
- `fetch_geopolitical_risk(date_range)` — pulls GPR index from Fed

**Agent loop (ReAct-style):**
```
Observe → Think → Act → Observe → ...
```

Agent iterates: tries feature set → evaluates → refines → explains

### 4. Temporal Evaluation Framework
Walk-forward cross-validation — no future data leaks into training context.
- Backtesting with Sharpe ratio, regime accuracy metrics
- Comparison vs. baselines (XGBoost, simple momentum)
- Uncertainty calibration plots

### 5. Authentication

JWT-based auth on the backend, NextAuth.js on the frontend. Dependencies are already installed (`python-jose`, `passlib[bcrypt]`, `next-auth`); the implementation is planned for the Mid tier.

**Backend**
- User model in PostgreSQL (SQLModel)
- `POST /api/auth/register` — hashed password via `passlib[bcrypt]`
- `POST /api/auth/token` — OAuth2 password flow, returns short-lived JWT access token
- `JWT_SECRET` + `SECRET_KEY` added back to `Settings` when this is wired up
- FastAPI `Depends(get_current_user)` dependency guards all non-public routes
- Run history is scoped per user — `GET /api/history` returns only the authenticated user's runs

**Frontend**
- NextAuth.js with a Credentials provider backed by `POST /api/auth/token`
- `useSession()` hook gates the dashboard; unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login`
- API client attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every request
- OAuth providers (GitHub, Google) can be added later by configuring NextAuth.js — no backend changes needed

## Domain: Energy / Oil & Gas Market Intelligence

**Why:** Driven by a small, well-defined set of signals that map cleanly to tabular features. Regime shifts are historically distinct and well-labeled. Geopolitical risk (Russia-Ukraine, Middle East) is the unique angle most quant models ignore — directly quantifiable via the Fed's free Geopolitical Risk Index. Highly relevant and easy to explain to any interviewer.

### Data Sources

| Signal | Type | Source |
|---|---|---|
| WTI / Brent crude price | Time series | `yfinance` |
| EIA weekly inventory builds | Time series | EIA API (free) |
| Baker Hughes rig count | Time series | `yfinance` / BH website |
| OPEC production quota changes | Tabular event | manual / news |
| US dollar index (DXY) | Time series | `yfinance` |
| Global PMI / industrial demand | Time series | `fredapi` |
| Geopolitical Risk Index (GPR) | Time series | Federal Reserve (free) |
| Refinery utilization rate | Time series | EIA API (free) |

### Prediction Tasks
1. **Regime classification**: bull supercycle / range-bound / bust / geopolitical spike
2. **WTI price direction**: up/down over next 4 weeks
3. **Energy equity outperformance**: will XLE beat SPY next quarter?

### Agent Reasoning Example
> "Rig count is falling while inventory builds are rising → supply response lagging → regime likely transitioning from contraction to early recovery → historically XLE and OIH outperform in this phase → confidence 78%"

### Historical Regimes (training labels)
- **Supercycle**: 2021–2022 (post-COVID demand + Russia-Ukraine war spike)
- **Bust**: 2014–2016 (shale glut), 2020 (COVID demand collapse)
- **Geopolitical spike**: 2022 Feb–Mar (Russia invasion), 2024 Middle East escalation
- **Range-bound**: 2017–2019, 2023

## Future Extension: Image Data (Phase 2)

Adding satellite imagery as an additional signal source — a natural next step once the core pipeline is stable:

- **Oil storage tank fill levels** — satellite images of floating-roof tanks; shadow angle reveals inventory volume. Provides independent cross-check against EIA reports.
- **Refinery activity** — thermal/optical imagery of refinery flare stacks and facility activity
- **Shipping traffic** — satellite AIS + imagery of tanker congestion at key chokepoints (Strait of Hormuz, Suez)

**Pipeline addition:**
```
Satellite image → vision encoder (e.g. DINOv2) → embedding vector
                                                          ↓
                                    Concatenate with tabular features
                                                          ↓
                                              TabPFN (unchanged)
```

This keeps TabPFN as the unchanged inference engine — images just become additional numerical columns after embedding, requiring PCA or feature selection to stay within the 2000-feature limit.

## Key Technical Differentiator

Agent-driven iterative feature refinement:

```python
for iteration in range(max_iterations):
    features = engineer_features(data, current_config)
    cv_score = temporal_cross_validate(tabpfn, features, labels)

    if cv_score > threshold:
        break

    next_config = agent.reason(
        current_score=cv_score,
        feature_importances=get_shap_values(tabpfn, features),
        data_characteristics=describe_data(data),
    )
    current_config = next_config
```

---

## Repo Structure

Two separate repositories:

```
temporal-agent/        # Python backend
temporal-agent-ui/     # Next.js frontend
```

### `temporal-agent` (backend)
FastAPI server exposing REST and WebSocket endpoints. All agent logic, TabPFN inference, and data pipelines live here.

```
temporal-agent/
├── src/
│   ├── agent/         # LLM agent, tools, ReAct loop
│   ├── featurizer/    # TimeSeriesFeaturizer
│   ├── inference/     # TabPFN wrappers
│   ├── data/          # FRED, yfinance connectors

├── api/               # FastAPI routes + WebSocket handlers
├── tests/
└── pyproject.toml
```

### `temporal-agent-ui` (frontend)
Next.js app. Consumes the backend API and streams agent reasoning steps in real time via WebSocket.

```
temporal-agent-ui/
├── app/               # Next.js app router pages
├── components/
│   ├── RegimeDashboard/       # Oil market regime display
│   ├── PriceDirectionCard/    # WTI/Brent prediction
│   ├── GeopoliticalRiskChart/ # GPR index overlay
│   ├── AgentStream/           # Live agent thought stream
│   ├── FeatureImportance/     # SHAP chart
│   └── BacktestChart/         # Walk-forward performance
├── lib/               # API client, WebSocket hook
└── package.json
```

### API Contract (backend → frontend)

**REST:**
- `POST /analyze` — trigger a full analysis run, returns `run_id`
- `GET /runs/{run_id}` — fetch completed run results
- `GET /history` — past analyses

**WebSocket:**
- `WS /runs/{run_id}/stream` — streams agent steps in real time

```json
// Stream message format
{ "type": "thought",      "content": "Classifying current macro regime..." }
{ "type": "tool_call",    "tool": "run_tabpfn", "input": { ... } }
{ "type": "tool_result",  "tool": "run_tabpfn", "output": { ... } }
{ "type": "prediction",   "regime": "slowdown", "confidence": 0.82 }
{ "type": "done",         "summary": "..." }
```

WebSocket streaming is important here — the agent's ReAct loop is iterative and can take several seconds. Streaming each step to the UI makes the reasoning transparent and the UX feel alive.

## Phase 2: Derivatives Exposure Visualization

Once the core regime prediction pipeline is stable, the regime output becomes the **input** to a derivatives pricing module. This is the "action layer" on top of TabPFN — what a trader actually does with the regime signal.

### The Bridge

```
TabPFN regime classification
        ↓
Vol regime lookup (historical realized vol per regime)
e.g. geopolitical spike → σ ≈ 45%, range-bound → σ ≈ 22%
        ↓
Stochastic valuation model
        ↓
Monte Carlo path simulation
        ↓
European / American call pricing + visualization
```

The agent surfaces this naturally:
> "Current regime: geopolitical spike. Historical 30-day realized vol in this regime: 45%. Here is what a WTI 1-month call at strike $85 looks like under these conditions."

### Stochastic Models

| Model | When to use |
|---|---|
| **GBM** (Geometric Brownian Motion) | Baseline, simple, good for European calls |
| **Heston** (stochastic volatility) | More realistic for energy — vol is not constant |

### Simulation Output

- **N simulated WTI price paths** over option tenor
- **European call price**: `E[max(S_T - K, 0)]` discounted
- **American call price**: Longstaff-Schwartz or binomial tree (early exercise premium)
- **Greeks**: delta, gamma, vega, theta

## User Flow

### Step 1 — Home Page
User opens the app and sees:
- Current energy market overview (latest data timestamp)
- Summary of last analysis (if any)
- A prominent "Start Analysis" button

### Step 2 — Configure Analysis
User clicks "Start Analysis" and sets:
- **Time range**: historical data window (e.g. past 5 years)
- **Prediction targets**: regime classification / WTI price direction / XLE outperformance / or all
- **Advanced options** (collapsible): feature window sizes, ensemble count, enable anomaly detection

### Step 3 — Agent Reasoning Stream (core experience)
User clicks "Run". The page switches to a real-time streaming view with two columns:

**Left — Agent Thought Stream** (WebSocket, live)
```
🔍 Fetching EIA inventory data and FRED macro series...
⚙️  Tool call: engineer_features (windows: 20d, 60d)
🧠 Feature set score: 0.71 — adding yield curve slope feature...
⚙️  Tool call: run_tabpfn (classification)
📊 Regime: Geopolitical Spike (confidence 82%)
⚙️  Tool call: run_tabpfn (regression — WTI direction)
💡 WTI likely up next 4 weeks. XLE expected to outperform SPY.
✅ Analysis complete
```

**Right — Results Rendered Live**
- Regime card (appears as soon as classified)
- WTI price direction indicator
- Confidence bars filling in progressively

### Step 4 — Full Dashboard
Once complete, the full dashboard renders:
- **Regime card**: current regime + historical regime timeline
- **WTI direction card**: predicted direction + confidence interval
- **Geopolitical Risk chart**: GPR index overlay on WTI price
- **Feature importance chart**: SHAP values — which signals drove the prediction
- **Backtest chart**: walk-forward strategy performance vs. SPY benchmark
- **Agent analysis report**: natural language summary of the full reasoning chain

### Step 5 — Derivatives Panel (Phase 2)
Below the main dashboard, a "Derivatives Exposure" panel:
- User inputs: spot price, strike, tenor, option style (European / American)
- Regime auto-fills the vol assumption
- Panel renders:
  - Animated Monte Carlo path fan chart
  - Payoff surface (price vs. time)
  - Greeks dashboard (delta, gamma, vega, theta)
  - European vs. American side-by-side comparison

### Step 6 — Follow-up Questions
User can type follow-up questions in a chat box below the report:
- "Why is energy expected to outperform?"
- "What if the GPR index rises another 10 points?"
- "Show me how the model performed during the 2022 war spike"

Agent calls the relevant tools and streams back the answer.

### Step 7 — Save & Export
- Analysis saved to history (accessible from home page)
- Export as PDF report or CSV data
- Shareable read-only link
